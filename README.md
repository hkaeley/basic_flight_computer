# basic_flight_computer
Arduino code for a basic flight computer which I created for my Eta Kappa Nu initiation.
I need to still do some more calibration testing with the altitude and pressure data.
I have created a video to describe the code if needed: https://youtu.be/SYQQSod4008
I have also created a video to show the hardware prototype if you are interested: https://youtu.be/kN_9DKQnRFg
Both these clips are taken from my initiation video so excuse any references I make to the remainder of the video which is not shown.
